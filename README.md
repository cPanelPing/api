cPanelPing Remote Restart API
=============================

This is the api responsible for automatic cPanel services restarting that is initiated upon reported downtime by cPanelPing.com monitoring services. 

Currently, this API restarts MySQL and in most instances also restarts Apache.

This api is still a tad experimential, but has been tested to work on multiple servers thus far.

Please use at your own risk.
